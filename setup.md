title: Setup
---

I recommend that you have installed Anaconda with Python 3.7 (https://www.anaconda.com/; click on „Downloads“ and than chose "Python 3.7"). With Anaconda you will not only get Python 3 and the most important data science packages, but also Jupyter Notebook with which we will work throughout the workshop.

In addition, you have to install the software Gephi https://gephi.org/ . Gephi is used for graph visualisations and is a quite common tool in digital humanities.
Both Anaconda and Gephi will work on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux).
