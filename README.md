# Exploring and Analyzing Network Data with Python â€“ for Humanities Researchers

The workshop uses a lesson from [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/exploring-and-analyzing-network-data-with-python) to introduce humanities researchers to historical network analysis.

In many humanities disciplines, researchers will come across networks: personal networks, correspondence networks, literary networks, to name just a few. But analysing these networks and drawing conclusions from the data and visualisations doesn't come naturally and following an online-tutorial on your own often turns into a frustrating exercise in googling jargon and trying to make sense of code and data that is unintelligible.

In this workshop, we will cover how to use the NetworkX package for working with network data in Python and how to analyse humanities network data. We will look into network structure and path lengths, important or central nodes, and communities and subgroups.
