# Outline for workshop (draft)

## Prerequisites

* Download and install Python 3 (use guide from SWC, see below)

[Python](https://python.org) is a popular language for research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well.  Installing all of its research packages individually can be a bit difficult, so we recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) an all-in-one installer.

Regardless of how you choose to install it, **please make sure you install Python version 3.x** (e.g., 3.6 is fine).

We will teach Python using the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all [supported](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#browser-compatibility), some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not.

How to install

|Windows|Mac|Linux|

If you aren't comfortable doing the installation yourself stop here and request help at the workshop.)<br> Open a terminal window. <br> Type <pre>bash Anaconda3-</pre> and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd>. The name of the file you just downloaded should appear. If it does not, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the file, for example with: <pre>cd Downloads</pre> Then, try again.<br> Press <kbd>Return</kbd>. You will follow the text-only prompts. To move through the text, press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd>. Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the default location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to prepend Anaconda to your <code>PATH</code> (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).<br> Close the terminal window.|

* Download and install [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), for help, check [system requirements](https://gephi.org/users/requirements/)

* Pen, paper, adhesive dots, sticky notes
